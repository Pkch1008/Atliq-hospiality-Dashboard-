# AtliQ Hospitality Analysis Dashboard

This repository contains the AtliQ Hospitality Analysis Dashboard, created as part of the Codebasics Resume Project Challenge. The dashboard provides insights into the performance of AtliQ hotels across various cities, focusing on key metrics such as revenue, occupancy rates, booking trends, and customer ratings.

## Project Overview

The AtliQ Hospitality Analysis Dashboard is designed to help stakeholders understand the business performance of AtliQ hotels over a three-month period. The analysis includes:
- **Revenue by City**: Comparison of hotel revenues across major cities.
- **Occupancy Rates**: Occupancy percentages for each city and property.
- **Customer Ratings**: Average customer ratings by city and property.
- **Booking Platforms**: Analysis of booking platforms and their contribution to total bookings and cancellations.
- **Weekly Trends**: Weekly analysis of revenue and ratings.
- **Property Performance**: Detailed insights into the performance of individual properties.

## Tools Used

### 1. **Power BI**
   - **Data Import and Transformation**: The dataset was imported into Power BI from various sources, including Excel and databases. Power Query was used to clean and transform the data.
   - **Data Modeling**: Relationships between different tables (e.g., Cities, Properties, Bookings) were established to create a comprehensive data model.
   - **DAX Calculations**: DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) was used to create calculated columns and measures, such as total revenue, occupancy rates, and average ratings.
   - **Visualizations**: Power BI visuals, such as bar charts, line charts, tables, and maps, were utilized to create an interactive and insightful dashboard.
   - **Filtering and Slicers**: Filters and slicers were added to allow users to interact with the data, such as filtering by city, property, or booking platform.

### 2. **Business Terms and Metrics**
   - **Revenue**: Total income generated from hotel bookings, segmented by city and property.
   - **Occupancy Rate**: The percentage of available rooms that are occupied during a specific period.
   - **Average Rating**: The average customer rating for each hotel, based on feedback scores.
   - **Booking Platforms**: Different platforms (e.g., Direct Online, Logtrip, Makeyourtrip) used by customers to make bookings.
   - **Cancellation Rate (CR)**: The percentage of bookings that were canceled.

## Outcome Summary

The AtliQ Hospitality Analysis Dashboard yielded several key insights:

- **Revenue Leaders**: Mumbai led in total revenue generation, followed closely by Bangalore. These cities were significant contributors to the overall revenue, with Mumbai alone generating ₹669 million.
- **Occupancy Rates**: Delhi had the highest occupancy rate at 61%, suggesting higher demand or better management in this city. Bangalore, though generating substantial revenue, had a lower occupancy rate of 56%.
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Delhi again topped the charts with the highest average customer rating of 3.8, indicating superior customer satisfaction levels.
- **Booking Platform Performance**: Direct online bookings and third-party platforms like Logtrip and Makeyourtrip were major contributors to total bookings. However, direct offline bookings had a substantial impact as well, especially in premium and presidential room categories.
- **Property Insights**: AtliQ Palace generated the highest revenue at ₹304 million with a strong occupancy rate of 60%. Meanwhile, AtliQ Seasons showed potential for improvement with the lowest average rating of 2.29 and occupancy rate of 44%.

These insights can be leveraged by AtliQ Hospitality to optimize operations, enhance customer satisfaction, and increase overall profitability.
